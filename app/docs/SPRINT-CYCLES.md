## SPRINT-CYCLES.md

This document outlines the sprint cycles for the development of an application that grabs information from 3rd party marketplaces.

### Cycle 1

**Duration:** 1 week

**Goals:**

* Implement the 3rd-party API integrations using Rust.
* Design and implement the data pre-processing pipeline.
* Write unit tests for the API integrations and data pre-processing modules.

**Tasks:**

* Research and select the appropriate 3rd-party API integrations for the target marketplaces.
* Implement the API integrations using Rust and the reqwest crate.
* Design and implement the data pre-processing pipeline using Rust and the csv, regex, and chrono crates.
* Write unit tests for the API integrations and data pre-processing modules.
* Document the API integrations and data pre-processing pipeline.

**Deliverables:**

* Functional API integrations for the target marketplaces.
* A data pre-processing pipeline that cleans and formats the data.
* Unit tests for the API integrations and data pre-processing modules.
* Documentation for the API integrations and data pre-processing pipeline.

### Cycle 2

**Duration:** 1 week

**Goals:**

* Implement the database connection and data insertion logic.
* Design and implement the data upload module.
* Write unit tests for the database connection, data insertion, and data upload modules.

**Tasks:**

* Research and select the appropriate database technology for the application.
* Implement the database connection and data insertion logic using Rust and the sqlx crate.
* Design and implement the data upload module using Rust and the reqwest crate.
* Write unit tests for the database connection, data insertion, and data upload modules.
* Document the database connection, data insertion, and data upload modules.

**Deliverables:**

* A database connection and data insertion module.
* A data upload module that uploads the pre-processed data to the JDI_Product_Listing_Master API.
* Unit tests for the database connection, data insertion, and data upload modules.
* Documentation for the database connection, data insertion, and data upload modules.

### Cycle 3

**Duration:** 1 week

**Goals:**

* Implement the cleanup tools for the application.
* Design and implement the logging and error handling modules.
* Write unit tests for the cleanup tools, logging, and error handling modules.

**Tasks:**

* Design and implement the cleanup tools for the application.
* Design and implement the logging and error handling modules using Rust and the env_logger crate.
* Write unit tests for the cleanup tools, logging, and error handling modules.
* Document the cleanup tools, logging, and error handling modules.

**Deliverables:**

* Cleanup tools for the application.
* Logging and error handling modules.
* Unit tests for the cleanup tools, logging, and error handling modules.
* Documentation for the cleanup tools, logging, and error handling modules.

### Cycle 4

**Duration:** 1 week

**Goals:**

* Integrate all the components of the application.
* Conduct system testing and performance testing.
* Deploy the application to a production environment.

**Tasks:**

* Integrate all the components of the application.
* Conduct system testing and performance testing.
* Deploy the application to a production environment.
* Monitor the application and address any issues that arise.

**Deliverables:**

* A fully functional application that grabs information from 3rd party marketplaces.
* System and performance test results.
* A deployed application in a production environment.

### Success Criteria

The application will be considered successful if it meets the following criteria:

* It successfully retrieves data from the target 3rd party marketplaces.
* It pre-processes the data correctly and inserts it into the database.
* It uploads the pre-processed data to the JDI_Product_Listing_Master API.
* It is reliable, efficient, and easy to maintain.

### Risks and Mitigation Strategies

The following risks have been identified for this project:

* **Technical complexity:** The application is technically complex, involving multiple technologies and integrations.
* **Data quality:** The quality of the data retrieved from the 3rd party marketplaces may vary.
* **Time constraints:** The project has a tight deadline.

The following mitigation strategies have been identified to address these risks:

* **Technical complexity:** The project will be broken down into smaller, more manageable tasks. Experienced developers will be assigned to the project.
* **Data quality:** The data pre-processing pipeline will be designed to handle data quality issues.
* **Time constraints:** The project schedule will be carefully planned and monitored.

### Open Issues
